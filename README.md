# Tic-Tac-Toe
A Tic Tac Toe game that uses Minimax Algorithms for PvE Mode

Hello, this is a project that was originally used for one of my classes. I am now polishing it and making it finer and more efficient.
Special Credits go to Rain Ding. He was my partner for the project.
That being said, I almost modified everything and I was the original creator for the algorithms too.

Highligts:
- Used minimax algorithms in "see_the_future" and "board_analysis" functions
- Can see 3 depths ahead
- Also supprot Player vs Player mode

Shortcomings:
- Can only see 3 depths ahead
- Code is still somewhat messy
- Player cannot choose to go first or second for PvE mode
- Can reduce calculations with symmetry

Anyway, hope you find my code helpful.
Sincerely,
Jerry Kuo 2018/Dec/23
